## Chart of Accounts

is simply a list of all the accounts that a business uses to keep their records organized

Configuration -> Chart of Accounts

COA may look different depending on fiscal position

Note: It is recommended to change the existing CoA instead of creating a whole new chart

Note: `Current Year Earnings` account type is unique to Odoo. Do not modify this

Check all CoA records then actions -> export

In export pop-up window, check the `I want to update data` checkbox

select `chart of accounts` in the template field

click export to generate an xlsx

open xlsx in spreadsheet

it is recommended to highlight columns that should not be updated like `id` and `account type`

to create a new CoA, go to the most bottom part of xlsx and add values to all columns except `id`.

`id` is autogenerated by odoo

go back to CoA list view then click import button

select import CoA

upload the xlsx that you modify earlier

test first to check if everything is valid

click import. All of the modified or new CoA is now in database
