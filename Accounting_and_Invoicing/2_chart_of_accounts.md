## Chart of Accounts

is simply a list of all the accounts that a business uses to keep their records organized

Configuration -> Chart of Accounts

COA may look different depending on fiscal position

Note: It is recommended to change the existing CoA instead of creating a whole new chart

Note: `Current Year Earnings` account type is unique to Odoo. Do not modify this

Check all CoA records then actions -> export

In export pop-up window, check the `I want to update data` checkbox

select `chart of accounts` in the template field

click export to generate an xlsx

open xlsx in spreadsheet

it is recommended to highlight columns that should not be updated like `id` and `account type`

to create a new CoA, go to the most bottom part of xlsx and add values to all columns except `id`.

`id` is autogenerated by odoo
