## Issue a credit note

Credit note is used to notify customers that a refund has been issued

Journal Entry of a credit note is the opposite of invoice

Go to Journals form and check the field `dedicated credit note sequence`

to create credit note, go to customers -> credit note

another way is to go to posted invoice then click `credit note` button.

a pop-up window will appear. click `reverse` to do partial credit note. click `reverse and create invoice` to do full credit note then modify the newly created invoice

check informations on both credit note and invoice once credit note has been confirmed
