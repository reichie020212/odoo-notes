## Payment terms and Terms and Condition

To ensure invoices are paid correctly and ontine, we need to add payment terms. This has three different options:
- set deadlines
- split payments
- payment discounts

To configure Payment Terms, go to Configurattion -> payment terms

Enable `Detault Terms and Conditions` on Config Settings

Upon enabling it you can either use a note or a link to a web page for your terms and conditions
