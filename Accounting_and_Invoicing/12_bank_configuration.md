## Bank Configuration

Go to config settings to configure accounts for bank transactions and payments

`Bank Suspense` - is the account that is used just temporarily opposite the `bank` accounts itself between when the bank transaction is created and when it is reconciled

`Outstanding Receipts` - is a holding account that is the opposite of the account receivable on the jounral entry for our customer payments. Then when the bank transaction is reconciled, this outstansding receipts account replaces the bank suspense account on the journal entry of the bank transaction

`Outstanding Payments` - behaves the same way as Outstanding Receipts account but for when we register outgoing payments to vendor bills

`Internal Transfer account` - it is used to balance the JE of any transfers that we make from one bank or cash account to another
