## Work Center Parameters

Go to Configuration -> Work Center -> open one record

Time Efficiency field - the value entered here represents how efficient the work center is when it comes to processing work orders in relation to their expected duration

Capacity field - represents how many units of a product can be produced at this work center

OEE Target - stands for Overall Equipment Effectiveness. here we can set a goal for how efficient we want the work center to be. This is calculated on the expected duration versus actual duration of work orders. by default this is set to 90%

Setup Time - Represents amount of time needed to setup the work center before processing a work order

Cleanup Time - Represents amount of time needed to cleanup the work center after finishing a work order

in the MO -> Work Orders tab, the expected duration is based on the amount of time to manufacture a product, Time Efficiency field, and the amount of product that a Work Center can produce simultaneously
