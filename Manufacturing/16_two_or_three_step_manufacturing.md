## Manufacture in 2 or 3 steps

two or three steps are a must for companies with larger manufacturing and inventory operations

Tracking not only what gets made but also where components come from and where finished products are stored helps keep everything run smoothly

in 2-step, Odoo creates a transfer to move components from storage to production area. However, once manufacturing is complete, finished products don't get an automatic transfer to storage

in 3-step, odoo adds another transfer. First, moving the components to production where we do the building, then moving the finished products to storage

to define 2 or 3 step, enable `Multi-step routes` in inventory configuration. Then set the Manufacturing step in the Warehouse menu inside Inventory -> Configuration
