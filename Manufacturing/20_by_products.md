## By-Products

by-products are secondary or residual materials produced incidentally during the manufacturing process of a main product

Example: Producing a wooden chair (main product) results in wood chips or sawdust (by-products). 

Enable the `By-Products` in Manufacturing Config Settings

By enabling `By-products` a new tab in Bill of Materials and MO named `By-products` will appear.
