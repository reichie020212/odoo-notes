## Sub-Assemblies

Sub-assembly is when we manufacture a component before using it to manufacture another product

to simplify, an MO under an MO

create a BoM, make sure that one of the component is a product with a route `MTO` and `Manufacture`

create MO then confirm, another MO will be created and you can check it on `Child MO` smart button.

when on the child MO, you can go back to the Source MO by click the `Source MO` smart button.
