## Manufacturing Efficiency

Overall Equipment Effectiveness, also known as OEE, is the gold standard for measuring a company's manufacturing productivity.

OEE helps us identify the percentage of truly productive manufacturing time across work centers

identifying productivity losses helps pinpoint areas for improvement, making operations more efficient and cost-effective.

Go to Work Centers Overview to see the OEE per Work Centers.

If OEE is green, it means work centers are meeting their targets.

if the OEE drops below the target, then the number will turn red.

OEE Target percentage can be set inside the Work Center -> General Information tab

To see the work centers productivity measures, click the OEE link.

Once inside the OEE link, click on the chart to redirect to Workcenter Productivity form. Here, you can add any productivity issues.
