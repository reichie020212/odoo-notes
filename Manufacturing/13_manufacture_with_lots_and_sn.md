## Manufacutre with lots and Serial Numbers

Serial Numbers - allow to track each finished unit individually through the entire process, ensuring complete visibility for every item that comes off the production line.

Lots - allow to track groups of products produced or received together, making them ideal for batch-bavsed manufacturing where items don't require individual identifiers.

Enable `Lots and Serial Numbers` in Inventory Settings

Set the `Track Inventory` field of a product in Products form -> General Information tab. for now set it to `Unique SN`

create a new MO for that product, confirm the MO.

Lot/Serial Number can be set by either clicking the `Generate Serial` button or the `Produce All` header button.

After clicking `Produce All`, a pop-up window will show that will help in assigning lots or SN. click `Apply` once done.
