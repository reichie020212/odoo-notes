## MRP Overview

In most manufacturing workflow, the process start with engineering. the engineers are responsible for designing a product

once the design is finalized, the next step is to create a Bill of Materials (BoM)

BoM is the recipe for manufacturing

once BoM is in place, check the required components against the onhand inventory

If parts are short, then we can auto trigger the creation of RFQs with the approved vendors.

And once materials arrive at the facility, the inventory team routes each one through a quality check or straight its or straight to storage location

Inventory team shoud log the receipt or barcode or S/N. In some cases, put their lots or S/N

Manufacterer pull the exact components the system reserved. Raw materials are consumed, recorded, and finished products are produced

Inventory Operators manages the delivery of the manufactured product.

When there is a returned product, Quality Team inspect the product, analyze, do root cause analytsis, and other things

quality team may do either or both of the following
- Quality Control Points (QCP) - a predefined check or inspection that is automatically triggered at a specific stage in your workflow.
- Engineering Change Order (ECO)

Maintenance team to do scheduled prevantative tasks and log corrective repairs on equipment
