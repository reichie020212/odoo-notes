## Managing Equipment Maintenance

Create an equipment to Maintenance App -> Equipments -> Machines & Tools -> Set all fields

Don't forget to set the fields in `Product Information` and `Maintenance` tabs.

Odoo will automatically generate a maintenance request if we've defined a preventative maintenance frequency

These requests are only generated once daily

Go to Work Centers form -> Equipment tab to add/update an equipment

To create Maintenance Requests to specific maintenance team, go to Maintenance App -> Dashboard -> click the `To do` button of the selected team -> click `New`
