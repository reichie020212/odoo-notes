My Personal Odoo Notes

This repo consists of my odoo notes based on [Odoo Learn](https://www.odoo.com/slides).
Note that some of the notes here came from my actual notes in my old notebook which derives from the old version of odoo so there's a chance that some buttons or menus are not existing anymore in the latest version of odoo
