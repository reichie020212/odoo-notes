## Closest Location Removal Strategy

Enable `Storage location` and `Multi-step routes`

Note: Ordering of location is based on its alphanumeric name

Open the parent location then set the removal strategy to `Closest location`

Note: If incase there's a child location that should not be included in the ordering of closest location, you should set the removal strategy to the child location that is not included
